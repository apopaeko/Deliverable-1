This Arduino project is about password protection. The user enters a password and one of two messages will display: "Password Correct!" for a correct entry or "Incorrect Password!" for an incorrect entry. It seems fairly self explanitory, however, there is more to it. I implemented an LED to alert users when the password has been entered incorrectly three times, and I am currently in the proccess of adding a buzzer to the project as well. 

Requirements:
  Hardware:
    - a laptop with at least 256 MB of RAM, a CPU that's Pentium 4 or newer, and a USB-A port.
  Software:
    - you will need to download the Arduino IDE application to your computer
      + in addition, you will need to upload the 1.8.6 Arduino AVR Boards through the application
  Arduino Case:
    - you will need the following components from the Arduino case: the breadboard, usb cable, controller board, 10 jumper wires (plus another 3 if you would like to add a buzzer), membrane switch module, an LED, and one         resistor (plus an active buzzer if you would like).
